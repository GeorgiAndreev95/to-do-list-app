# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and interactive To-Do List web application built with **React** and **TypeScript**.  
This project was created to practice working with object state management, component-based architecture, and strongly-typed code.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

-   **HTML**
-   **CSS Modules** (component-scoped styling)
-   **JavaScript**
-   **React**
-   **TypeScript**
-   **React Motion** (smooth, high-performance UI animations)

## 🚀 Features

-   Add, edit, complete, and delete tasks
-   Add subtasks to exisitng tasks
-   Local storage persistence
-   Clean and modular component structure

## 🖥️ Usage

-   Click the Add Task button to create a new task.
-   Set a due date using the calendar button. If no due date is selected, the task is displayed under a "No Due Date" tab.
-   Click on a task description to add subtasks. The subtasks are added in a dropdown tab beneath the main task and can be collapsed by pressing the arrow icon next to the main task description.
-   Toggle task completion using the checkbox icon. Marking the main task as completed marks all subtasks as well.
-   Edit tasks or subtasks using the pencil icon.
-   Delete tasks or subtasks using the cross icon.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of:

-   Manipulating stateful data (objects and arrays)
-   Writing strongly-typed React components with TypeScript
-   Organizing reusable UI components
